# Raspberry pi IMU code
### USU Rocket Team  
Adapted from code from the USU Center for Space Engineering

Very much a work in progress.
most of this code can probably be ignored.

Currently in use are IMUtest.cpp and src/imu/imu.cpp with src/imu/imu.h

for now to make an executable for now just do it manually:

g++ --std=c++11 IMUTest.cpp src/imu/imu.cpp
